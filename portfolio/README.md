## Description
Short discription

--In this repository you will find the code to a website that I built using HTML CSS npm node.js vive & most importantly three.js for all of the animation of objects in the scene and the field of view changes as scrolling.
 

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can‚Äôt be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.
